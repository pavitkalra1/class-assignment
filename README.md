                    answer-   40-30-20-70-35-50-80

Question 2)  Construct an inverse BST with BFS and DFS as their traversal and a function named display which prints the BST from bottom to top 

                          40
                30               70
           20      35        50   80

 answer-      80-50-35-20-70-30-40
